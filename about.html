    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a student in metro Atlanta studying for a Bachelor's of Computer Science at Western Governors University. I am scheduled to graduate in December of 2025. In the meantime, I have created this website for myself to document projects for hands-on learning and to showcase my skills as I progress through my degree program and career.</p>
    <p>I plan to concentrate on data science and scripting/programing. Currently, the most exciting area of computer science to me is the potential of AI assisted clinical decision-making in healthcare.</p>
